I give her my love, / she says "No, no, no, / no," /
And I give her my heart, / she says "No, no, no, / no, /
'Cause your / only a friend to me, /
More like a brother to me." /

She's a pretty little girl / who says "No, no, no, / no," /
Just a little girl, / and she knows I love her so, /
If I / ask her to walk with me, /
She shakes her head at me. /

She's a pretty little doll / who says "No, no, no, / no," /
All the night-time through, / she says "No, no, no, / no." /
If I / ask her to walk with me, /
I know she'll never say "Oui." /

?

She says / "You're only a friend to me, /
Only a brother to me." /

She's a pretty little girl / who says "No, no, no, / no," /
Ooh, the night-time through, / she says "No, no, no, / no." /
If I / ask her to walk with me, /
Why won't she ever say "Oui?" /

No, no, no, / no. /
No, no, no, / no. /
No, no, no, / no. /
No, no, no, / no. /
No, no, no, / no. /
No, no, no, / no.
