[Verse 1]
Vacation for a week
We sexin on the beach
And I aint taking bout the drink
Open doors fo her when I take her out to eat
Um rollin up a suite while she massage a nigga feet
Lil shawty so fine
I gotta sippin wine
I tell her I dont cheat but she be knowing a nigga lyin
Her friends cant stand me
Dey dont understand me
While dey hoe hoppin I gotta shoppin in miami
Everythings g her fi bought a jeep
A bag a coupla grands and they compliments for me
See I can be the king and she can be my queen
And we can be a team
And fulfill each other dreams
I love the way she talk
Love the way she walk
Um always on her mind and she always on my thoughts
I got her at the house
We blowin on an ounce
Um cooking dinner for her tonight we aint going out

[Chorus]
I meet alot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes but some I say no
I be like no no no you can go go go
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches
[2x]

[Verse 2]

It started up in france
But now we gotta plan

Over seas we holding hands
Gucci louie parada

So she love me like her father
Cruising the atlantic

Spaghetti strap dressshe aint wearing panies

Sex her on the couch
Freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I mite go buy her a mink
[2X]

[Chorus]
I meet alot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes but some I say no
I be like no no no you can go go go
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches
